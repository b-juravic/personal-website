export const project1 = "Jobly is an online job board, built as a mobile first responsive single page React application, complete with authentication and search functionality. Once a user has registered and/or logged in, they gain access to the private routes only accessible by authenticating and theyâ€™re greeted with a personalized welcome message when on the home page. Users have the ability to browse all jobs and all companies, as well as search jobs by title and search companies by name. Users can also apply to jobs and edit information in their user profile. Backend note: I wrote my own version of the backend; however, this deployed application uses a backend written by Rithm School so everyone would have the same code when building the frontend."
