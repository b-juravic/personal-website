export const aboutP3 = "At Rithm, I get to combine my love for building web applications and solving problems with my passion for supporting and empowering curious learners. Our program's curriculum includes advanced JavaScript concepts, server-side programming with Python, automated testing, database management, web security, and single page applications with React. I work alongside a wonderful instruction team to deliver a high-quality educational experience and as an engineer I create, enhance, and maintain in-house software products. Throughout the program I spend the bulk of my time giving lectures and supporting students in lab by answering technical questions, providing assistance with debugging, and conducting live code reviews where students get immediate feedback on their work. When I'm not giving a lecture or lab support, I'm grading technical assessments, making curriculum updates, conducting technical interviews, or doing some dev work.";
