export const aboutP1 = "I’m Brittiany,  a new software engineer and former higher education professional. Last summer I began teaching myself JavaScript and I fell in love with programming. Several months later, I made the decision to pursue this passion full-time."

export const aboutP2 = "Since then, I have attended Rithm School, a full stack web development bootcamp in San Francisco, and interned as a software engineer at CleverCounsel, a legal services software company. At CleverCounsel I had the opportunity to design, build, and test new features, and produce/ implement solutions for reported bugs."

export const aboutP3 = "My favorite accomplishment of the internship was designing and building the password reset feature, allowing users to request a link to reset a forgotten password, which included all backend endpoints, email integration and cryptographic hashes, form validation, frontend React components, and backend/ frontend tests. (technologies/tools included Python, Flask, Flask-Mail, JavaScript, React, itsdangerous, WTForms, and AWS Simple Email Service)"

export const aboutP4 = "Prior to making the transition to software engineering, my career in higher education began at a small art and design college in Florida, where over the course of six years I worked my way up from a loan coordinator to the director of student financial services."

export const aboutP5 = "My interest in software engineering began at UC Berkeley where I managed the Federal Work-Study Program administered by the Financial Aid and Scholarships Office. While my expertise was financial aid, a couple campus transitions to new software systems led to frequent collaboration with business analysts and developers, as we discussed needs of the program and issues/ bugs with the newly implemented software. This was my first introduction to whiteboarding and I quickly learned how much I enjoyed the problem solving process and through this collaboration, I also developed an interest in the technical side of the program. At this point I began teaching myself JavaScript by  getting up at 4:30am each day before work to spend time working through online tutorials and right away I was hooked. Several months later I made the decision to make a career change."

export const aboutP6 = "I’m now looking forward to the next chapter of my journey, in a role where I can continue to learn and grow as a full stack software engineer."
