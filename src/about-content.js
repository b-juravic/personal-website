export const aboutP1 = "I’m a higher education professional turned software engineer and tech educator. I decided to make a career change after a coding curiosity led to months of getting up at 4:30am each day to teach myself JavaScript before going to work. I have since completed a full stack web development program and currently work as a software engineer and instructor at Rithm School.";

export const aboutP2 = "Prior to my career pivot, I spent almost 10 years as a higher education professional. My interest in programming began at UC Berkeley where I managed the Federal Work-Study Program administered by the Financial Aid and Scholarships Office. In this position I served as the subject matter expert for the program and was part of a wonderful team working to ensure successful administration of the program. Our team had a designated business analyst and developer and as I worked alongside them I became increasingly fascinated with the technical side of the program. I became curious about coding and began teaching myself JavaScript in my spare time and eventually decided I wanted to learn how to design and build web applications. I joined a full stack web development program and have been building ever since!";

export const aboutP3 = "I’m currently a software engineer and instructor for a full stack web development program at Rithm School. Our program’s curriculum includes advanced JavaScript concepts, server-side programming with Python, automated testing, database management, web security, and single page applications with React. I work alongside other members of our instruction team to educate and support students enrolled in the program and as an engineer I create, enhance, and maintain in-house software products. Over the course of the program I spend much of my time supporting students in lab by being available to answer technical questions, providing assistance with debugging, and conducting live code reviews where students get immediate feedback on their work. When I’m not in lab, I’m likely giving a lecture, grading technical assessments, making curriculum updates, conducting technical interviews, or doing some development work.";
